      <h1>9. Bake - <span>9:30AM (next day)</span></h1>
      <p>Take one of your plastic bag-wrapped loaves out of the fridge and unwrap it. Cut a piece of parchment paper so it fits over the top of your basket and place on a pizza peel. Invert the peel and parchment paper so they are resting on top of your basket containing your dough. Then flip the whole thing over. Remove the basket and your dough should be resting on the parchment.</p>
      <p>Score these loaves at a 90° angle between the razor blade and dough. If you want a more pronounced “ear” at each score line, lower the angle between the blade and the dough (so the blade is close to horizontal with the dough).</p>
      <p>While wearing your oven mitt, and with caution, pull out your dutch oven. Using your pizza peel, drag a corner of the parchment paper to slide your dough into the dutch oven. Place it back into the oven and cover. This sealed environment helps trap the escaping steam from your dough to steam the exterior of the loaf as it bakes, encouraging maximal rise.</p>
      <p>Bake for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, use your oven mitt to very carefully remove the lid. Close the oven door and bake for 25 more minutes. If you are unsure if your bread is done, use your thermometer to test the internal temperature, it should register over 208°F (97°C).</p>
      <p>When done, carefully use your oven mitt to remove the bread from the dutch oven (I will grab a corner of the parchment paper and drag the cooked bread out of the cooker) and cool on a wire rack.</p>
